-  Build a metronome program as a QNX resource manager for "/dev/local/metronome".
-  Implement features to pause the metronome for 1-9 seconds via console commands.
-  Ensure the metronome operates with visual output to simulate "clicks".
-  Accept three command-line parameters: beats-per-minute, time-signature-top, time-signature-bottom.
-  Program must correctly output single characters at a rate based on the beats-per-minute and time-signature parameters.
-  Include error handling for invalid commands and provide a help feature displaying the metronome's API.
