## Status
The assignment is complete, all requirements are met. Processes are killed approprietely and expected messages are
printing to the screen. No Crashes
I also handled a few points of input validation that are not mentioend in the assignment such as:
	incomplete set command (missing params)
		No vals are set unless all params are entered
		usage message will follow
	incomplete pause comand (no pause val)
		usage message will follow
 
## Known Issues
My nano secs is sometimes slightly different than your expected output. For example, instead of 150000000 i can get 150000005.
Unfortaently i have to pick my battles, and had to move on to other things. Hoping this small nuance doesn't amount to much


## Expected Grade
I'm expecting full marks but the slight nanosec difference could impact my grade I suppose. It really depends how important that tiny flaw becomes

Thank you,
